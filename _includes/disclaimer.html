          What is all this really about?
        </h3>
        <p>
        We are a bunch of actual geeks, we hang out at a place called <a href="http://ascii-dresden.de/">ascii</a> which is an actual caf√©, residing in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2018084">APB</a> of the <a href="http://tu-dresden.de">TU-Dresden</a>.
        We grew tired of being asked why that place is called "ascii" and not "unicode" or "utf8" so we made up this fake hipster coffee-joint to be able to blame them for already having taken the name.
        Come visit us and say hello. We do have sofas :D
