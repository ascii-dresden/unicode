        You want to come here to drink coffee? No! You come here to code! Great software is always produced under the influence of high levels of organic caffeine and love ♥.
        You're looking for a place to birth your software</a>? We offer you a coffee-driven couch-based integrated development environment.
        No one ever produced quality software in a cubicle.
        And if your software takes off, thank us by mentioning you wrote it on one of our quality suede sofas, sipping the finest brew in all of Dresden.
